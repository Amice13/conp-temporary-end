# Temporary Suspension of the Court on the Palm Project

> It was fun. Wasn't it?

Dear friends and users,

We want to thank you for being part of the Court on the Palm community since its launch in 2018. Our mission has always been to make court decisions more accessible and meaningful by processing them through data cleaning, entity recognition, and enrichment using official open data sources.

Unfortunately, since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, access to many of these crucial data sources has been restricted. The Ministry of Justice no longer publishes the Unified Register of Legal Entities, the State Judicial Administration has stopped releasing judges’ names, and further limitations on the Register of Court Decisions continue to be discussed.

For the past few years, we have maintained the service as an archive of court decisions from January 2018 to February 2022. However, due to these growing constraints, we have decided to temporarily suspend access to the platform.

We deeply appreciate your trust, support, and engagement throughout these years. We hope to return once the environment allows us to provide transparent and reliable data again.

Warm regards,

**The Court on the Palm Team**
